# WooCommerce Dimensions Tab
WooCommerce does not show the dimensions of individual variations by default. This plugin hides default dimensions and weight from the Additional Information tab. To use the plugin you must add a custom attribute named "Size" and add dimensions and weight to the variations using that attribute.

If there are no attributes with "Visible on the product page" checked then a new tab is created with the title Dimensions and it shows both the dimensions and weight.

*NOTE: Each product variation must have a price to have the dimensions appear.*
